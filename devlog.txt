**CLEAN REBUILD** (Dec 20, 2024 15:30)
- File size hit 24.8KB (929 lines) - nearly double the 13KB js13k limit
- Code became unmaintainable with feature creep and debug logging
- Made complete rebuild decision to preserve working mechanics
- Backed up bloated version to main-backup.js
- Created clean version with all core features preserved:
  ✓ Cat eyes with tilted ovals, diamond pupils, mouse tracking
  ✓ Firefly attraction/rescue system with spacebar charging
  ✓ Purple safety zone with breathing animation and score multipliers
  ✓ Prowl meter danger system
  ✓ Simple audio (Web Audio oscillators instead of complex ZzFX)
  ✓ Particle effects and natural firefly floating
- Target: Under 13KB for competition compliance
- Next: Test functionality and optimize for final submission


**CAPTURE/RELEASE MECHANICS** (Aug 14, 2025 17:50)
- Implemented sophisticated firefly capture system
- Gameplay flow: Attract → Capture → Drag → Release → Rescue in zone
- New mechanics:
  ✓ Fireflies get "captured" when touched while charging (spacebar held)
  ✓ Captured fireflies follow player exactly, keeping up with fast movements
  ✓ Each captured firefly has random offset for natural clustering
  ✓ Release spacebar = fireflies disperse quickly away from player
  ✓ Only captured fireflies can be rescued in the purple zone
  ✓ Visual distinction: captured fireflies glow blue-white vs yellow-green
- Enhanced audio feedback: capture sound + disperse sound
- Strategic depth: Risk/reward of holding many fireflies vs safety
- File size: 13.8KB (still under 14KB, close to 13KB limit)
