# The Cat & the Luminid - JS13K 2025 Entry

**Theme**: Black Cat  
**Category**: Desktop  
**Final Size**: 6.3KB  
**Controls**: Mouse + Keyboard

*A peculiar story of shifting colors, fleeting light, and an arrangement no one quite understands.*

Once, on a night that might have been the same night forever, a Cat watched the world from above, and a Luminid drifted through the grass below. The Cat's eyes shimmered and changed - blues into greens, greens into gold - as if they knew secrets the Luminid could never name. Or perhaps it was the other way around.

Between them, a strange game began. The Luminid gathered fireflies whose glow matched the Cat's eyes; the Cat's eyes, in turn, changed as if to test the Luminid's wit. Was the Cat setting the challenge, or was it following the Luminid's lead? Neither seemed certain, and neither seemed to mind.

All that was known, and only at night, was that the two would meet again, and the colors would change, and the game would go on until the moon grew tired of watching.

## How to Play

- **Move**: Drift your mouse to guide the little blue Luminid through the night grass
- **Glow/Collect**: Hold the left mouse button or spacebar to shine your light and lure passing fireflies  
- **Deliver**: Carry your glowing fireflies to the Cat above and release them spiraling into her waiting gaze
- **Mind the Change**: Keep fireflies of the wrong color when her eyes shift, and they vanish like they were never there
- **Quick Summon**: Rapid clicks or taps call more fireflies to your side... though no one knows from where
- **Audio Toggle**: Press `M` to quiet the night, should you wish to play in silence

## Game Features

- **Dynamic Storytelling**: A peculiar tale of interdependence between Cat and Luminid
- **Atmospheric Environment**: Twinkling stars, swaying grass, particle effects
- **Progressive Challenge**: Color changes become more unpredictable over time  
- **Lightweight Audio**: Clean Web Audio API sounds (~200 bytes total)
- **Session Statistics**: Track fireflies collected and lost across all runs
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to any screen size

## Technical Implementation

**Competition-Optimized Pipeline:**
- **Terser**: Dead code elimination and variable minification
- **Roadroller**: Advanced JavaScript compression for JS13K  
- **Asset Inlining**: Single HTML file with embedded CSS/JS
- **Size Result**: 6.3KB compressed (well under 13KB limit)

**Core Technologies:**
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) - No frameworks
- Canvas 2D API - Hardware-accelerated rendering
- Web Audio API - Lightweight sound system
- Modern optimization techniques

## Development

```bash
# Setup
npm install
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Build for submission  
npm run build

# Individual build steps
npm run minify     # Terser compression
npm run compress   # Roadroller + inline assets  
npm run zip        # Final submission ZIP
```

### How to Play

- **Move**: Drift your mouse to guide the little blue Luminid through the night grass.
- **Glow/Collect**: Hold the left mouse button or the spacebar to shine your light and lure passing fireflies. But take care - the Cat in the sky grows fickle, and her eyes change their fancy without warning.
- **Deliver**: Carry your glowing fireflies to the Cat above and release them spiraling into her waiting gaze.
- **Mind the Change**: Keep fireflies of the wrong color when her eyes shift, and - poof - they vanish like they were never there.
- **Quick Summon**: A quick flicker (rapid clicks or taps of the spacebar) calls more fireflies to your side… though no one knows from where.
- **Audio Toggle**: Press `M` to quiet the night, should you wish to play in silence.
