> The Luminid gathered fireflies whose glow matched the Cat's eyes; the Cat's eyes, in turn, changed as if to test the Luminid's wit. Was the Cat setting the challenge, or was it following the Luminid's lead? Neither seemed certain, and neither seemed to mind. All that was known, and only at night, was that the two would meet again, and the colors would change, and the game would go on until the moon grew tired of watching.

## Game Overview

You are the Luminid, a wanderer of nightlight. Drift through the dark meadow, where fireflies shimmer with the same hue as the Cat’s ever-watchful eyes. Draw them close with your glow, then offer them to the Cat above to renew your fading mana.

But be wary - when the Cat’s gaze begins to change, the bond with your gathered fireflies grows fragile. A single shift could scatter them back to the shadows. Call upon your shield to protect what you’ve gathered, or summon new fireflies from the night itself, at the cost of your own mana.

The challenge is endless, as long as the Cat watches and the fireflies answer.

## Controls

- **Mouse Movement**: Guide your firefly form around the night
- **Tap: Left-Click / Spacebar**: Unleash a quick burst of shield (uses mana)
- **Hold: Left-Click / Spacebar**: Sustain your shield, draining mana as long as it’s active
- **H Key**: Show or hide the help overlay

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Core Loop
1. **Collect** fireflies by drawing near them
2. **Watch** The Cat’s eyes for shifting colors - danger is near
3. **Shield** during shifts to protect your gathered fireflies
4. **Deliver** fireflies to the Cat to score points and restore mana

### Strategic Elements
- **Mana Management**: Every shield drains mana; every offering restores it
- **Timing**: Well-timed shields during eye shifts maximize survival
- **Risk vs Reward**: Carry more fireflies for bigger scores - but greater loss if unguarded

### Special Features
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: The Cat’s gaze grows quicker and more unpredictable over time
- **Mana Fireflies**: Golden fireflies appear in moments of low mana
- **Heat System**: Overusing shields or summons overheats your power, leaving you briefly exposed
