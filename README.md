## Game Overview
> You are The Luminid, a wanderer of nightlight. Drift through the dark forest, where fireflies shimmer as The Cat's ever-watchful eyes follow. Draw them close with your glow, then offer them to The Cat above to renew your fading bioluminescence.
> 
> But be wary - when The Cat's gaze begins to change, the bond with your gathered fireflies grows fragile. A single shift could scatter them back to the shadows. Call upon your shield to protect what you've gathered, or summon new fireflies from the night itself, at the cost of your own bioluminescence.
> 
> Survive the full night (10 minutes) until sunrise by collecting fireflies, managing your bioluminescence, and timing your shields perfectly when The Cat's eyes shift colors.

## Controls

- **Tap: Left-Click / Spacebar**: Summon additional fireflies (uses bioluminescence)

## Key Features

## Scoring System
