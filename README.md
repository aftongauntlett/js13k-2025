## Game Overview

You are Lampyris, guide of fireflies in the eternal night. Move through the darkness to collect fireflies and deliver them to Nyx Felis in the Sky to sustain the night.

When Nyx's eyes begin to shift and change colors, your gathered fireflies are in danger. Use your protective shield with perfect timing to save them, or summon new fireflies from the night itself - but both cost precious bioluminescence.

Survive until dawn (10 minutes) by mastering shield timing, managing your energy, and building delivery streaks for bonus points.
